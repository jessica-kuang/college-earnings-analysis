# College Earnings & Institutional Characteristics

This project explores how institutional characteristics of U.S. colleges—such as institution type, degree level, tuition cost, and admissions selectivity—relate to median earnings 10 years after entry. Using data from the U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard, the analysis applies exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques in Python to surface insights relevant to students, families, and policymakers.
